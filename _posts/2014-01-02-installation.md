# Installation

Choose one of the following packages:

* No packages but smallest size
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_core
```

* Everything from the previous package plus accepted SBML extensions
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_stable
```

* Everything from the previous package plus all SBML extensions (including proposed extensions)
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_experimental
```

These packages get larger but have more features as you go down the list.
Your choice will depend on which SBML extensions you need, and how much
bandwidth you want to conserve.
If you don't know, try `libsbmljs_stable`.
