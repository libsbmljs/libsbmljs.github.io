# Installation

Choose one of the following packages:

* No packages but smallest size
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_core
```

* Everything in `libsbmljs_core` plus accepted packages
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_stable
```

* Everything in `libsbmljs_stable` plus all packages (including proposed packages)
```
npm install --save libsbmljs_experimental
```

Your choice will depend on which packages you need, and how much
bandwidth you want to conserve.
If you don't know, try `libsbmljs_stable`.
Learn more about the different branches.

The libSBML C++ library maintains two separate branches:
the "stable" branch for accepted packages
and the "experimental" branch for proposed packages.
