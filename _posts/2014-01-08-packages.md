# Packages

libsbmljs comes in [libsbmljs_core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsbmljs_core), [libsbmljs_stable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsbmljs_stable), and [libsbmljs_experimental](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsbmljs_experimental) npm packages.
The difference between them is the number of [SBML extensions](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_3_Packages) supported in each version.
If you don't know what extensions you need, go with the "stable" package.
It can read all models in the BioModels and BiGG Models databases.

The libSBML C++ library maintains two separate branches:
the "stable" branch for accepted extensions
and the "experimental" branch for proposed extensions.
The extensions in the experimental branch are not finalized yet - they are subject to change,
and any code that relies on them will have to be changed as well.
If you don't require any SBML extensions at all, you can go with the "core" build, which has the added benefit of giving you the smallest npm package.

Package size (uncompressed):

|`core`|3.0M|
|`stable`|6.4M|
|`experimental`|9.5M|
