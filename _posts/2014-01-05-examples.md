# [Examples](https://github.com/libsbmljs/examples)

We provide a number of Node.js [examples](https://github.com/libsbmljs/examples) showing how to use libsbmljs and the various packages contained in the stable and experimental builds. We recommend you try the Node.js examples first, since they are easy to get started with and allow for a lot of experimentation.

If you are designing web apps, you are probably using Webpack. We also provide an [example](https://github.com/libsbmljs/webpack-example) showing how to use libsbmljs with Webpack to bundle the JavaScript assets for a web app.
