# Source Code

A libsbmljs wrapper can be generated from the source tree of the libSBML C++ library.
The build scripts generating the libsbmljs wrapper are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/libsbmljs/libsbmljs).

If you're looking for the source code of libSBML itself, please visit the [libSBML site](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).
