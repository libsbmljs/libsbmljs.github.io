# Demo

To demonstrate one way libsbmljs can be used, there is a simple demo which allows the user to search the BioModels and BiGG Models databases and example the models contained therein.

After selecting a model, you have the option of running the SBML validator on the model - the client-side validator included in libsbmljs, not the web service.

View the demo.
