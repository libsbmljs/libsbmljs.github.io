# [Demo](https://libsbmljsdemo.github.io/)

We provide a simple [demo](https://libsbmljsdemo.github.io/) which allows the user to search the BioModels and BiGG Models databases and read individual models using libsbmljs.

After selecting a model, you have the option of running SBML consistency checks (a.k.a. validation) on the model. You may be familiar with the [SBML Online Validator](http://sbml.org/Facilities/Validator), but libsbmljs does **not** use the Online Validator. The demo runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly. It does **not** rely on any external web services.
